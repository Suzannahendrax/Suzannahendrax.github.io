<h2> How to Make </h2>
<h3> Step 1 </h3>
<p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add sausage, onion, bell pepper, and garlic, and cook, stirring, until sausage is browned and vegetables are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. </p>
<h3> Step 2 </h3>
Stir in pasta sauce, sugar, salt, and black pepper; bring mixture to a boil over medium- high. Reduce heat to low; simmer 15 minutes.
<h3> Step 3 </h3>
<p>Cook pasta according to package directions, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water. Stir chopped basil into meat sauce. Stir in up to 1/2 cup reserved cooking water, adding 1/4 cup at a time, if needed, to reach desired consistency. Serve sauce over cooked spaghetti. Garnish with shaved Parmesan cheese, if desired.</p>
<h3> Chef's Notes </h3>
<p>Pasta is one of the quickest meals you can make, but there's an easy way to get it on the table even faster: When you're filling your stockpot from the tap, use very hot water to kickstart the boiling process. (Try this to speed up blanching or boiling vegetables too.)</p>
